            <p class="mbr-text py-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">While migratory movements occur in both humans and animals, the issue of emotionality is unique to humans. Emotions such as joy, sadness, strangeness, and a sense of belonging are part of our complex nature. When we migrate to places with different cultures and languages, we become more aware of our own, allowing us to understand ourselves within a complex world of expressions that vary across cultures. The focus here is on gestures and movements as expressive elements of our bodies that convey emotions.
<br>
<br>IMPULS | THE CORE is a series of digital sculptures initially created for the experimental film "El Impulso" by Arnaldo Drés González, inspired by his own migrant experience from South America to Europe. It visually simplifies feelings, presented through an audiovisual narrative that invites viewers to recognize themselves in a foreign environment, reflecting the simplicity and complexity of human communication.
<br>
<br>IMPULS | THE CORE comprises fifty-four unique digital works in animated GIF format. Each image encourages dialogue by challenging us to identify the movements and gestures it contains. This visual representation mirrors the emotional and mental experience of integrating into a culture with a different language, involving constant decoding of codes, symbols, emotions, and messages. It also reflects the tolerance and understanding needed to embrace the unknown.
<br>
<br>Each GIF art represents a core and together forms a single digital piece. The artist's body coexists with an organic element that lives, moves, and expresses itself, traveling and migrating within this space.
<br>
<br>For "El Impulso," Arnaldo used a single video file to build a multidimensional imaginary world, applying an abstract aesthetic based on recording his hand movements in front of a camera, akin to capturing a language. This makes the work a lens-based art piece transitioned to a digital environment.
<br>
<br><strong>IMPULS | THE CORE - NFTS
<br></strong>
<br>The entire series is available as collectible NFTs, each one a unique animated GIF with variations in gestures and movement determined by time, rhythm, and personal contemplation. This collection highlights the complexity of languages, body expressions, and emotional evocations, requiring curiosity, patience, and contemplation. You might find a GIF that resonates with your own understanding.
<br>
<br>Until recently, video art and new media were primarily showcased in physical spaces like galleries and museums. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, digital media usage has surged, increasing the visibility of digital art. The rapid development of blockchain technology has further strengthened the digital arts space, enhancing exposure, global reach, and financial support for artists.
<br>
<br>Arnaldo Drés González not only invites us to appreciate his digital artwork but also allows us to collect it. We are here to explore the universe of González's visual art—a spatial imaginary featuring analog forms in digital environments, contemporary abstraction created through digital lenses, and processed by video editing software.<br></p>
